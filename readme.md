To summarize the transcript of a YouTube video, run the `app.py` script with the video URL as an argument:

```bash
youtube-summary "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=your_video_id"
```

Replace `your_video_id` with the actual video ID.

Note that generating a summary might take a couple of minutes, depending on the video's transcript length.
